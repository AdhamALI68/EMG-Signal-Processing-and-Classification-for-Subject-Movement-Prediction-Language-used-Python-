# EMG-Signal-Processing-and-Classification-for-Subject-Movement-Prediction-Language-used-Python-
Implemented the approach to filter and classify EMG signals from 3 subjects, utilizing data from 10 electrodes with 100Hz sampling rate and applying a high-pass filter to clean the data. Analyzed the frequency spectrum of EMG signals for Subject 1, comparing the data before and after filtering.
